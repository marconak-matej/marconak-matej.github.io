# About Me

Hello! I'm **Matej Marcoňák**, a Software Engineer based in Slovakia with over a decade of experience delivering robust, scalable backend systems across banking, insurance, finance, public administration and advertising.

My engineering journey started in 2014, building internal systems for managing insurance claims. Since then, I’ve worked on a wide range of high-impact projects—from central metadata systems for public administration to large advertising platforms and financial systems used in production today.

Over the years, I’ve gained deep experience with **microservice architectures**, **distributed systems**, **API integrations** and **cloud-native development**. I’ve also led engineering teams, ensured code quality through reviews and testing practices and contributed to internal libraries and shared components.

Currently, my focus is on building **high-performance, resilient systems** in the banking, insurance and finance sectors using technologies like **Java 21**, **Spring Boot**, **Kafka**, and **Azure**.

I’m passionate about writing clean, maintainable code, improving developer productivity and designing systems that scale reliably.
